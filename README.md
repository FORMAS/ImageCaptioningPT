Image Captioning for Portuguese Language

* An image captioning method for the Portuguese language by an encoder-decoder model with an attention mechanism when employing a multimodal dataset translated into Portuguese. Our findings suggest that: 1) the original and translated datasets are pretty similar considering the measure achievements; 2) the translation approach includes some dirty sentence formulations that disturb our model for the Portuguese language.
